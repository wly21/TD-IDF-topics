# TD-IDF-topics
Part of the project ***Analysis on salient topics on Reddit after the U.S. election (2020)***.  
  
The data contains the daily hot posts (total n = 2004) in subreddits /r/conservative and /r/politics collected between Nov 25th - 27th 2020, which are annotated on 6 topics respectively (whether related or not).  
This program calculates the TD-IDF values from the data to select the top mentioned words in the topics and subreddits.  
The results are exported into the json file, and latex table format is also provided at the end of the Notebook.  
*Topics: ”trump_loss”, ”biden_president”, ”election_fraud”, ”covid”, ”anti_trump” and ”trump_last_month”
